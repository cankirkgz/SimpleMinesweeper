<h1>Minefield Game</h1>

  <p>Welcome to the Minefield Game! This is a simple console-based game where you have to navigate through a minefield without stepping on any bombs.</p>

  <h2>Gameplay</h2>

  <p>The minefield is represented as a grid of cells, where each cell can either be empty ('-') or contain a bomb ('*'). Your task is to reveal all the empty cells without triggering any bombs.</p>

  <p>At the beginning of the game, you will be prompted to enter the number of rows and columns for the minefield. A random number of bombs will be placed in the minefield, and the rest of the cells will be empty.</p>

  <p>You will then take turns entering the row and column numbers of the cell you want to uncover. If the selected cell contains a bomb, the game is over. Otherwise, the cell will be revealed, and it will display the number of surrounding bombs. Your goal is to uncover all the empty cells without hitting any bombs.</p>

  <p>The game continues until either all the empty cells are revealed or a bomb is triggered. If you successfully uncover all the empty cells, you win the game!</p>
